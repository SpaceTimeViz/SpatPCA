# SpatPCA
- Description: Provide regularized principal component analysis 
    - incorporating smoothness, sparseness and orthogonality of eigenfunctions 
        - seeking localized patterns
    - by using the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. 
    - can be applied to either regularly or irregularly spaced data.
